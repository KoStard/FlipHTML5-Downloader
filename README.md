# FlipHTML5-Downloader [DEPRECATED]
Download images from fliphtml5 and create PDF from them.
You can download the release 0.0.1 from [link](https://github.com/KoStard/FlipHTML5-Downloader/releases/download/0.0.1/fliphtml5downloader-win32-x64.rar).
Unzip the file and run the fliphtml5downloader.exe.
Write the link and press the download button.

## The issues
- They have changed the url structure of the images. So the downloader can't download the images.

## How to run locally
- Clone the repository
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`
